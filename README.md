# How to Contribute

If this is your first time contributing to an open-source project, don't worry; it's easier than you think! Here are the steps to get started:

### Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-name/Mini-Projects.git
```

where `your-name` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the Mini-Projects repository from GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd Mini-Projects
```

Now create a branch using the `git switch` command:

```
git switch -c your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git switch -c add-mini
```
## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

After Making Necessary Changes
If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add .
```
Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add your message"
```

replacing `your message` with your desired message.

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/compare-and-pull.png" alt="create a pull request" />

Now submit the pull request.

Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the main branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.\

**Your contribution will be merged, and you'll be part of the Hacktoberfest celebration! ðŸŽ‰**
